## Implementation

To add this dimension to your database:

1. Run the migration: `20250629123000_add_store_size_dimension.sql`
2. This will add a `store_size` column to the geography table
3. Existing stores will be automatically classified based on population
4. New views will be created for analysis:
   - `v_store_distribution` - Overview of all stores by type and size
   - `v_sari_sari_analysis` - Detailed sari-sari store metrics

## Benefits of Size Dimension

1. **Better Segmentation**: Understand different sari-sari store segments
2. **Targeted Strategies**: Develop size-specific product assortments
3. **Performance Analysis**: Compare stores within size categories
4. **Resource Allocation**: Optimize delivery and support by store size
5. **Growth Tracking**: Monitor stores transitioning between size categories
