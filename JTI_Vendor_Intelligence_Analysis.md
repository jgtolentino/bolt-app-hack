## üí° STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR PITCH

### 1. Position as Complementary, Not Replacement

‚ùå **Don't Position As:**
- "Replace your SAP/Oracle systems"
- "Better than Tableau/QlikView"
- "All-in-one analytics solution"

‚úÖ **Do Position As:**
- "Philippine market-specific intelligence layer"
- "Real-time field data that feeds your existing BI"
- "Fills the gap between POS and enterprise systems"

### 2. Integration is Key Message

Our dashboard must emphasize:
```
Field Data Collection ‚Üí Our Platform ‚Üí SAP/Oracle/Azure
     (Real-time)         (Processing)    (Enterprise BI)
```

**Key Integration Points:**
- REST APIs to feed SAP BW
- Azure Data Lake compatibility
- Oracle OBIEE data source
- Tableau dashboard embedding

### 3. Address the "Build vs Buy" Question

JTI has resources to build internally. Our advantages:

**Why Not Build Internally:**
- **Speed**: 6 months vs 18-24 months
- **Local Expertise**: Philippine retail nuances
- **Pre-trained Models**: Sari-sari store behaviors
- **Regulatory Knowledge**: Sin tax, plain packaging
- **Network Effect**: 10,000 outlets already mapped

### 4. Align with Their Digital Transformation

JTI's "Business Platform Modernization" focuses on:
- Cloud-first approach
- Single source of truth ("One Data")
- Agility and flexibility
- Real-time decision making

**Our Alignment:**
- Cloud-native on Azure
- Feeds their "One Data" initiative
- Agile deployment model
